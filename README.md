# Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I share my journey through web development with Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This repository is organized to showcase projects of increasing complexity, helping to build a strong foundation in front-end development.

## About This Repository

The goal of this repository is to:

1. **Progressively Build Skills**: Starting with simpler projects and advancing to more complex ones, each project focuses on core front-end development skills.
2. **Learn and Teach**: Each project includes a tutorial or guide, walking through the concepts and steps to complete it, making this repository valuable for anyone learning alongside me.
3. **Share Knowledge**: I believe in learning by teaching, so every project includes explanations, comments, and best practices to help others understand the code and concepts.

## Projects Overview

Below is a quick overview of the types of projects included in this repository:

- **Fundamental Projects**: Simple projects designed to introduce basic concepts in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
- **Intermediate Projects**: These projects build on the basics and introduce new topics like DOM manipulation, event handling, and styling techniques.
- **Advanced Projects**: More challenging projects that bring together various concepts, creating fully functional, interactive applications.

Each project is stored in its own folder under the repository root and contains:

- A README specific to the project
- Project files (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript)
- Step-by-step tutorial or guide
